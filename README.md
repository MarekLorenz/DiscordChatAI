Discord Chatbot with Pytorch

The code in the cbv1.py file contains an implementation of a Pytorch Chatbot for Discord with a more natural chat experience and extends its functionality, by giving access to all previous training states. Have fun trying it out or adding more features. The training data is provided by the Cornell Movie Database, but you can try to use larger datasets, that I don't have the capacity for, i.e. the Reddit Data Base, if you do so please keep me updated on your progress.
